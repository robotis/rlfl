RLF. Rogue Like Functions
jtm@robot.is

===========

Alpha Version 1.0

This is a collection of functions for roguelike games for use with the python programming language. FOV, 
pathfinding, projection, LOS and various helper functions. This is here to aid me in my hobby to create
a python roguelike. The aim is to build on alot more AI and fun stuff.

This is not a display library and contains no display functions.

Installation
============

	python3 setup.py install
OR
	python setup.py install

Then 
	import rlfl

Compile instructions (makefile).
--------------------------------

create a makefile (see makefile_32x or makefile_64x examples) and simply `make rlfl-python`. To use
with python place the `rlfl.so` file in your python path and `import rlfl`. Make sure to specify 
the python lib version you wish to compile against. Currently tested against python2.7 and 
python3.1

RLF can be built into a c lib without python support with `make rlfl`.

This code has not been tested on windows.
